Title: Earthquake Magnitude Prediction using Neural Networks

Introduction:
This document outlines the process of training a neural network model to predict earthquake magnitudes based on geographical features such as latitude, longitude, and depth. The model is trained using earthquake data collected from various sources.

Data Preprocessing:

The earthquake data is loaded from a CSV file, containing features like latitude, longitude, and depth, along with corresponding earthquake magnitudes.
The features are standardized using a StandardScaler to ensure uniformity and improve model performance.
The dataset is split into training and testing sets using a 80-20 split ratio.
Neural Network Architecture:

The neural network architecture consists of six fully connected layers (nn.Linear) with batch normalization (nn.BatchNorm1d) and dropout (nn.Dropout) layers to improve generalization and prevent overfitting.
The model architecture is as follows:
Input Layer (Size: 3)
Hidden Layer 1 (Size: 256) with Batch Normalization and Dropout
Hidden Layer 2 (Size: 512) with Batch Normalization and Dropout
Hidden Layer 3 (Size: 256) with Batch Normalization and Dropout
Hidden Layer 4 (Size: 128) with Batch Normalization and Dropout
Hidden Layer 5 (Size: 64) with Batch Normalization and Dropout
Output Layer (Size: 1)
Training and Evaluation:

The model is trained using the training dataset with Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss and Adam optimizer.
Learning rate scheduling is implemented using ReduceLROnPlateau to adjust the learning rate dynamically based on validation loss.
The model is evaluated using the testing dataset, and metrics such as MSE, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are calculated to assess its performance.
Results:

The model's performance on the test set is as follows:
Final Test Loss: 0.18295184330835368
Mean Squared Error: 0.18295184
Mean Absolute Error: 0.31537884
Root Mean Squared Error: 0.42772868
